\section{Power series & Taylor series}
General, it's pretty much the same as for real series. All of the old
tests for convergence still hold.

Both real part and complex part must converge, theorem 2

Absolute convergence

\paragraph{Ratio test}

\paragraph{Comparison test} Theorem 5

\paragraph{Root test}

\subsection{Power series}

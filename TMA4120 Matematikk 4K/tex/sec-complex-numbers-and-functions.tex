\subsection{Complex numbers}

\paragraph{Complex conjugate}
\paragraph{Euler formula}

Hyperbolic functions formula

\subsection{Complex function}
A complex function is said to have a limit if... eprsilon delta proof
+ corollary.

\paragraph{Entire functions}
Functions that are analytic on the entire complex plane.


\subsection{Analytic function}
You might remember conservative fields from Calculus 2, well analytic
functions are pretty much just like them. Any line integral over a
simply closed curve will be 0. In calculus 2 we learned that a
vectorfield could be decomposed by a Helmenholtz decomposition. Is
there an analogous decomposition of complex valued functions into a
analytic function and a ....



\paragraph{Definition}

\paragraph{Cauchy-Riemann equations}

\subsection{Laplaces's equation}
All analytic functions are solution to Lapaces's equation. Lapaces's
equation is the most important PDE in physics.

\begin{equation}
  (\nabla)^2 u = 0 =u_{xx}+ u_{yy}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Harmonic functions} Solutions of Laplaces's equation having
continuous second order derivatives are called harmonic functions.

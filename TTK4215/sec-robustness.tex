\section{Robustness}

\subsection{Parameter drift}
An unknown bounded disturbance added to the measurement $y$ can lead to \emph{parameter drift}, meaning $\theta \to \infty$ as $t \to \infty$. The equilibrium $\tilde{\theta}_e = 0$ can be made u.a.s. by making $u(t)$ PE. (But we don't always decide $u(t)$.)

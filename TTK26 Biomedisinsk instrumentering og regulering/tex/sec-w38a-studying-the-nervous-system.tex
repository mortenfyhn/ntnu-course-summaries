\section{Studying the nervous system}

Dendrites: Receptors.
Axons: Transmitter of the nerve cell. Some short (micrometers), some long (meters). Myelin sheath protects axon and helps signal transmission (insulative). Axons release neurotransmitters, which are picked up by other cell's dendrites.
Cell body/soma receives signals and sends to axon as an action potential.

Presynaptic cell sends a signal, post- receives. The synaptic gap is between them. The action potential cause the neurotransmitters to move to the other cell.
Synaptic transmission: Synapses are where two neurons exchange neurotransmetters.

Glial cells maintain the nervous system. Microglia protect the central nerv system. Macroglia do other supportive stuff.

\subsection{Cellular components of the nervous system}

\subsection{Neurons}

Sensory neurons have no dendrites, but have cell bodies responsive to term/touch/etc.

\subsection{Neural circuits}

Neurons org. in groups. nerv circuits.
Flow of information:
Afferent nerv cells: Information inward.
Efferent: Information outward.
Internerv: Korte lokale.

\section{History of medicine}
Biomedical engineering is engineering applied in medicine. Early witch doctors also used some empirical methods. Hippocrates was maybe the first consciously scientific doctor. Romans fixed some public health, esp. for troops. Hospitals, esp. before the 19th century, were places with high death rates for patients and staff. Florence Nightingale realized that the deaths were usually due to hospital conditions---not illnesses---and hospitals changed accordingly around the world. Science and technology have later changed hospitals and medicine dramatically. The biomedical engineer is really just an engineer who does something related to medicine.

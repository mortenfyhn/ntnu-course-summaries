\section{Adaptive pole placement control (APPC)}
APPC is pretty cool, because it does not require a plant of minimum phase (as opposed to MRAC).

\subsection{Indirect PPC}
Given the system
\begin{equation}
	y_p = \frac{Z_p(s)}{R_p(s)} u_p
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $R_p$ is monic, of known degree $n$,
	\item $Z_p, R_p$ are coprime,
	\item $G_p$ strictly proper ($\deg{Z_p} < n$).
\end{itemize}

The objective is to choose $u_p$ so that the closed-loop poles are the roots of a polynomial $A^*(s)$. Can be done by choosing $P$ (degree $q+n-1$) and $L$ (monic, degree $n-1$) such that
\begin{equation}
	L Q_m R_p + P Z_p = A^*
\end{equation}
is satisfied for $A^*$ of degree $2n+q-1$. $Q_m$ is chosen so that
\begin{equation}
	Q_m y_p = 0,
\end{equation}
and the control input is given by
\begin{equation}
	Q_m L u_p = -P (y_p - y_m)
	.
\end{equation}

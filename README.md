# ntnu-course-summaries

This repository contains more or less brief summaries of courses I've taken at NTNU.

## How to contribute

If you know something about the courses listed and want to add to the documents, simply create a pull request with your changes and additions. I have some simple guidelines:

* Always keep these in the preamble:
    * `\usepackage{libertine}`
    * `\usepackage[libertine]{newtxmath}`
* Use feature branches for larger contributions
* Write good commits
* Write tidy and understandable code

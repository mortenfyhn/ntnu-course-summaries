\section{Linear matrix inequalities}
Many problems in systems and control can be reduced to optimization problems involving LMIs, for which there exist efficient numerical solvers.

A strict LMI has the form
\begin{equation}
    F(x) \triangleq F_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m x_i F_i > 0
\end{equation}
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the variable, and $F_i = F_i^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $i = 0, \dots, m$. Multiple LMIs can be rewritten as a single LMI by stacking each matrix on the diagonal:
\begin{equation}
    \diag \left( F^{(1)}(x), \dots, F^{(p)}(x) \right) > 0
\end{equation}

% \subsection{Some mathematical background}
% A square matrix $W$ can be decomposed into a symmetric and a skew-symmetric part:
% \begin{equation}
%     W = \left( \frac{W + W^T}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{W - W^T}{2} \right)
% \end{equation}
